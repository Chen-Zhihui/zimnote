包含概率密度，分布计算，编译时计算
A C++ header-only library of statistical distribution functions. https://www.kthohr.com/statslib.html

https://github.com/Quanteeks/RandLib
With RandLib one can easily work with probability distributions. One of the major advantages of this library (apart from being free and open-source) is that it doesn't require any additional packages. All you need is C++17 compiler support.
What can you do with RandLib? Here are some useful examples:
	Fast sampling. For instance, generate million variates from standard normal distribution:
NormalRand X(0, 1);
std::vector<double> data(1e6);
X.Sample(data);
