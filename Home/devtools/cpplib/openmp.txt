Finds OpenMP support

This module can be used to detect OpenMP support in a compiler. If the compiler supports OpenMP, the flags required to compile with OpenMP support are returned in variables for the different languages. The variables may be empty if the compiler does not need a special flag to support OpenMP.

The following variables are set:

OpenMP_C_FLAGS - flags to add to the C compiler for OpenMP support
OpenMP_CXX_FLAGS - flags to add to the CXX compiler for OpenMP support
OPENMP_FOUND - true if openmp is detected
