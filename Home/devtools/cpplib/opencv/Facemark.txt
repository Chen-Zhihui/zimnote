Introduction

Facial landmark detection is a useful algorithm with many possible applications including expression transfer, virtual make-up, facial puppetry, faces swap, and many mores. This project aims to implement a scalable API for facial landmark detector. Furthermore, it will also implement 2 kinds of algorithms, including active appearance model (AAM) [1] and regressed local binary features (LBF) [2].
