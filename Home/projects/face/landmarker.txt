	FacemarkKazemi: This implementation is based on a paper titled “One Millisecond Face Alignment with an Ensemble of Regression Trees” by V.Kazemi and J. Sullivan published in CVPR 2014. An alternative implementation of this algorithm can be found in DLIB
	FacemarkAAM: This implementation uses an Active Appearance Model (AAM) and is based on an the paper titled “Optimization problems for fast AAM fitting in-the-wild” by G. Tzimiropoulos and M. Pantic, published in ICCV 2013.
	FacemarkLBF: This implementation is based a paper titled “Face alignment at 3000 fps via regressing local binary features” by S. Ren published in CVPR 2014.
